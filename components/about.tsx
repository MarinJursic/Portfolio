      My journey into technology began with a <span className="font-medium">fascination for building and creating things</span> that could make a difference. This curiosity led me to pursue a foundation in programming as a Computer Technician and, later, enroll in a <span className="font-medium"> Bachelor of Computer Science</span>  program to deepen my understanding of the field.

Along the way, I ventured into <span className="font-medium">freelancing</span>, where I turned my passion into a career. Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects, from building subscription platforms to designing responsive web applications and creating seamless user experiences. These experiences taught me the value of combining creativity with technical expertise to deliver solutions that are both functional and impactful.
